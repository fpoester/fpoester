- 👋 Hi, I’m Fabiano F. Poester, but here in Github I'm simply @fpoester
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code for my life, to showcase and learn about my interests and hopefully for my work as well. But I'm just at the beginning of my journey
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google Data Analytics, so I can have a formal certification and actually get a junior job that will teach me more skills overtime
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on visualisations and basic codes from others
- 📫 How to reach me: the best is through my email, fpoester@gmail.com
